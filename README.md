# Simple Macro Calculator

## How to Use:

Please answer the prompts with the required information. If your body fat percentage isn't known, then a population average will be used to estimate lean body mass.

If you have greater than average muscle mass for your weight and height, then it would be wise to find (DEXA), and enter your body fat percentage.

An accurate body fat percentage will ensure a proper protein target.

The protein target is set to 1.2 grams per lb of lean body mass.

## Body Fat Percentage:

### Known:

If your body fat percentage is known through a reliable method of testing (DEXA, Bod Pod), then it will be used to calculate your lean body mass.

### Unknown:

If your body fat percentage is unknown, then an estimate will be calculated the following way. 

The initial weight and height is used to find ideal body weight.

For each inch from 5 feet, a 5 lb change is adjusted to the initial weight.

Then, lean body fat is calculated.

#### Male:

The initial weight is 110 lbs.

The ideal body fat percentage is set to 12.5%.

##### Example:

Height: 5' 10"

160 lbs = 110 lbs + (10 inches * 5 lbs)

#### Female:

The initial weight is 100 lbs.

The ideal body fat percentage is set to 22.5%.

##### Example:

Height: 5' 5"

125 lbs = 100 lbs + (5 inches * 5 lbs)

## Safety:

### Overrides:

For practical purposes, certain hard stops have been implemented.

#### Weight Loss Per Week:

A hard stop of 2 lbs per week has been implemented to prevent daily calories from dropping too low.

#### Weight Gain Per Week:

A maximum gain of 1 lb per week is implemented. However, it is recommended to target 0.25 lbs per week to minimize fat gain.
